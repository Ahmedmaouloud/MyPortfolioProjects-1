# Movies Correlation With Python

This repository contains Python code for analyzing the correlation between various features of movie data.

## Overview

The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository analyzes a dataset containing information about movies. The notebook focuses on exploring the correlation between different numerical features such as budget, gross earnings, and votes. It utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## Contents

1. **Import Libraries**: Importing necessary libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
2. **Read in the Data**: Reading the movie data from a CSV file.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, changing data types, and creating correct columns for year and country.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Scatter plot of budget vs gross earnings.
   - Scatter plot with a regression line using Seaborn.
   - Calculation of correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical features.
   - Heatmap visualization of the correlation matrix.
5. **Numerical Encoding**: Numerically encoding categorical features for correlation analysis.
6. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Heatmap visualization of the correlation matrix after numerical encoding.
   - Identification of high correlation pairs and analysis of significant correlations.

## Usage

TTo use this Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you have installed Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
2. Download the 'movies.csv' dataset.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred Jupyter environment.
