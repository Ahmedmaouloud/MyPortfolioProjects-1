# COVID 19 Data Exploration Project 

## Introduction

Welcome to # COVID 19 Data Exploration Project This is my first project focuses on practicing Data Analyst, this portfolio project inspired by tutorials from "Alex the Analyst" YouTube channel. 
In this project we use SQL Server to explore global COVID 19 data.
The primary objective is to strengthen SQL skills and gain hands-on experience in data exploration and analysis.

## Project Tasks
### 1.Setting up PortfolioProject Database & Importing Tables
Begin by creating a PortfolioProject database in SQL Server Management Studio. Then, import the tables from CovidDeaths.xlsx and CovidVaccinations.xlsx into this database.
### 2. Retrieving Data from Tables
The project begins by  extracting data from the `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations` tables. The SQL queries retrieve all data from these tables while filtering out records with missing continent information.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Following the data retrieval, exploratory data analysis tasks are conducted. This includes selecting specific columns from the `CovidDeaths` table to analyze total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population. The data is sorted by location and population.

### 4. Analyzing COVID-19 Statistics
Several SQL queries analyze COVID-19 statistics, such as total cases, total deaths, and death percentages. For example, one query examines the total cases vs. total deaths in Mauritania, while another calculates the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 in various locations.

### 5. Comparing Infection and Death Rates
Further analysis compares infection and death rates across countries and continents. SQL queries identify countries and continents with the highest infection rates and death rates compared to population size.

### 6. Global COVID-19 Trends
Finally, global COVID-19 trends are explored through SQL queries. These queries calculate total population infected, total population death, and death percentage worldwide. Additionally, vaccination data is integrated to analyze total population vaccinated and vaccination trends over time.
